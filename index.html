    I don't know how to code, I dont know how to make apps, I don't know how to find exploits, I don't know how to hack, I don't know how to create a UI, but I'm learning. When I get bored, I jailbreak iPhones and iPads and install tweaks for fun. Some tweaks are not free, so I have to find the hacked version of them to avoid paying. I wish I can create a tweak of my own someday. Xen HTML widgets are usually created by using JavaScript and HTML, which is not far away from the course that I'm taking now.

        I am a high school student now studying in Canada. I spent 11 years of my life in China, almost including my whole childhood. When I was in grade four, I had an opportunity to go to school in the US for two years, so I did it. After the two years in the US, I spoke English fluentyly like a normal child who grew up in an English-speaking country. Of course, my teachers and classmates back then were facinated about my English skills, but they weren't happy about my loss of the ability to read, write, and recite Chinese. It took me a long time trying to get myself back on track. I had decent marks during the second year I came back from the US, which was pretty good. In my second semester of the first year of middle school, I surrendered. My mind was addicted to video games, and I couldn't stop playing during the night. It was not long before I heared my big news: I will be going to Canada in grade eight. At first, I was quite stunned to hear this, because my parents told me earlier that there was no possibility of me studying abroad anymore until college. Anyways, I obviously accepted the fact that I can go to school in Canada, and learn useful stuff instead of reciting lame useless texts.
